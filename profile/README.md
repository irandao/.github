### Products:
  1- **DDL (Direct Donation Line)**: an infrastructure that enables anyone to create an organization and define crowdfunding lines for specific purposes, with management handled through a multi-approval process. Our goal is to provide a decentralized platform that allows for transparent and democratic decision-making, empowering individuals and groups to take action towards the WomenLife Freedom Revolution.
  
  2- **Endgame**: A DAO that oversees a pool, assigns tasks, and compensates individuals for completing those tasks.


**Both products are built upon smart contracts, ensuring that no individual has control over them. Moderation is always community-driven, allowing for a fair and democratic system.**
